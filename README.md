# separate_bot
This is a simple bot written in Python. Its objective is to scrape the most popular subreddits (that permit bots) and cheekily (probably annoyingly) correct people when they've misspelled the most commonly misspelled word in the English language: "separate".

I mainly did this project to get a little more familiar with praw (Python Reddit API Wrapper), and to get more familiar with basic APIs in general. It was also a nice refresher on basic git commands, and I learned some new things on best practices when working in venvs and committing/pushing to a repository.
